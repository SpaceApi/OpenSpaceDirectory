SpaceAPI directory
==================

The Space API directory is a list of hackerspaces that have the Space API
implemented.

If your hackerspace is missing in the list, fork the repository,
add your space and create a pull request in Github.

Find more information about the SpaceAPI on https://spaceapi.io.

The purpose of the directory is to provide a stable API with a list of all
hackerspaces for applications like [MyHackerspace] and similar.
